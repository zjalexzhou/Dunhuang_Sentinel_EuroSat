## Introduction

The Urban ecosystem is vibrant, diverse but at the same time unpredictable and fragile as it is often subject to dynamic changes triggered by both human and natural factors. The collision between human residence and environment variability exacerbates when it comes to the marginalized regions like cities and towns adjacent to deserts or built on desert oases. Desertification and water shortage problems have been common in those areas. In recent years, the improved coverage and resolution of satellite imageries shed lights on local strategic planning process as remote sensing offers an informative and reliable way of both qualifying and quantifying land cover changes. Also, a novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification, EuroSAT, enriched the pool of ground-truth dataset based on Sentinel-2 images.

Dunhuang is a famous cultural heritage of Buddhism in Gansu Province, China, but it has faced environmental issues like lacking water resources and desertification for long. Several projects started to recover Dunhuang’s ecosystems, such as the “Haerteng River-to-Dang River water diversion” program launched in 2015, which aimed to recharge underground water in Dunhuang (Chen et al., 2016). Therefore, in this project, we plan to study the land cover change in Dunhuang as an attempt to help visualize the effects of the ongoing conservation programs in Dunhuang. To be specific, we will emphasize on quantifying the changes of urban and residential areas in Dunhuang within the latest 5-year range using deep learning classification results of Sentinel-2A images with our trained classifier based on the EuroSAT dataset.
